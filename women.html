            <div  style="margin-right: auto;">
            <p style="line-height: 35px; font-weight: bold;">Gender equity for women is the concept of ensuring that women have equal access to opportunities, resources, and rights as men. It aims to address the historical and systemic disadvantages that women have faced in various aspects of life and to promote a fair and just society where gender does not determine one's opportunities or treatment.
            </p> 
           </div>
            <div style="margin-left: auto;">
                <p style="line-height: 35px; margin-left: 25px; font-weight: bold;">Gender equity goes beyond simply treating men and women the same, as it recognizes that historical and social factors have created disparities and imbalances that need to be addressed. It involves acknowledging and rectifying the existing gender-based discrimination and bias that may be present in education, employment, healthcare, politics, and other spheres.</p>

            <p style="padding: 30px;margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 80px;line-height:40px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">Gender equity for women is not about diminishing or excluding men's rights and opportunities but rather advocating for equal rights and opportunities for all, regardless of gender. Achieving gender equity requires collective efforts from individuals, communities, governments, and organizations to challenge stereotypes, biases, and discriminatory practices while promoting inclusivity and equality for everyone.</p>

           <div style="margin-top: 50px;"><h4 style="color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">Health Care Benefits</h4></div>
            <div style="margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 80px;margin-top:10px;"><p style="font-weight: bold;">We cannot overemphasize the importance of gender equity in health care because the medical profession has favored the male anatomy in research and education. It was not until 1993 that Congress passed a law requiring clinical trials to include women and minorities in the study of diseases and treatments. Yet to this day, doctors are more likely to dismiss a woman’s physical pain as being mental, emotional or even suggest that the patient is a hypochondriac. An article on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/guide-toc" style="color: #800080;text-decoration: none;">WebMD</a> revealed that in 2016, Dr. Marjorie Jenkins published a national survey of sex and gender in medical education stating that only 34.5% of medical students “would feel prepared to manage sex and gender difference in health care.” True gender equity in health care means all genders are heard and treated well, instead of having their pain be dismissed based on their gender identity and anatomy.</p></div>

                <li style="font-size:25px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">Education</li>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Ensuring equal access to quality education for girls and women, as well as promoting the participation of women in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).Here are some key points regarding the importance and benefits of education for women:

                    <ol>
                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Empowerment:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Education empowers women by giving them knowledge, skills, and confidence to make informed decisions about their lives. It enables them to have a voice, participate in decision-making processes, and advocate for their rights and interests.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Economic Opportunities:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Educated women are more likely to access better job opportunities and higher-paying careers. When women are economically empowered, they can contribute to their families' financial well-being, reducing poverty and improving overall economic growth.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">

                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Educated women are more likely to have better health outcomes for themselves and their children. They have increased awareness of health practices, leading to lower maternal and child mortality rates.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Family Planning:

                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Education plays a crucial role in family planning and reproductive health. Educated women tend to have fewer children and have them later in life, contributing to smaller family sizes and better family planning practices.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">

                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Educating women has a ripple effect on future generations. Educated mothers are more likely to invest in their children's education, breaking the cycle of poverty and creating a path to a better future.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Resilience:

                    </li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Women bring diverse perspectives and experiences to leadership positions, enriching decision-making processes and fostering inclusivity. Diverse leadership teams are more likely to consider a broader range of viewpoints and find innovative solutions to complex challenges.</p>

                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Role Models and Mentors: 
                    </li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Women in leadership serve as role models and mentors for other women, inspiring and encouraging them to pursue leadership roles. Having visible female leaders helps break down barriers and challenges traditional stereotypes about women's capabilities.</p>

                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Empowerment:

                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Closing the Gender Gap:
                    </li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">By increasing women's representation in leadership roles, we work toward closing the gender gap that exists in various sectors. This not only benefits women but also creates a more balanced and fair society for everyone.</p>


                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Changing Organizational Culture: 
                    </li>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Leadership in women challenges the glass ceiling – the invisible barrier that hinders women's advancement to higher positions in organizations. Breaking these barriers is essential for achieving gender equity in the workplace and beyond.</p>



                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
