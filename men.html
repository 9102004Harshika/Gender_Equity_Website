            <div  style="margin-right: auto;">
            <p style="line-height: 35px; font-weight: bold;">As mentioned in the home page gender equity is not only about protecting and taking stand for rights of women or gender diverse people .It is also about taking stand for men.

                <p style="line-height: 35px; margin-left: 25px; font-weight: bold;">Gender equality is also a men's issue. Gender (in)equality concerns both women and men and has a strong impact on their daily lives. Historically gender equality policies have been contextualised mainly as a “women's issue” – as women have been a driving force behind gender equality strategies and struggles.</p>

While historically, the focus of discussions around gender equity has often been on promoting equality and reducing discrimination against women, it is essential to acknowledge that gender equity should also encompass the fair treatment of men.</p>

           <div style="margin-top: 50px;"><h4 style="color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">Health Care Benefits</h4></div>
            <div style="margin-left: 80px;margin-right: 80px;margin-top:10px;"><p style="font-weight: bold;">We cannot overemphasize the importance of gender equity in health care because the medical profession has favored the male anatomy in research and education. It was not until 1993 that Congress passed a law requiring clinical trials to include women and minorities in the study of diseases and treatments. Yet to this day, doctors are more likely to dismiss a woman’s physical pain as being mental, emotional or even suggest that the patient is a hypochondriac. An article on <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/guide-toc" style="color: #800080;text-decoration: none;">WebMD</a> revealed that in 2016, Dr. Marjorie Jenkins published a national survey of sex and gender in medical education stating that only 34.5% of medical students “would feel prepared to manage sex and gender difference in health care.” True gender equity in health care means all genders are heard and treated well, instead of having their pain be dismissed based on their gender identity and anatomy.</p></div>

                <li style="font-size:25px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">Parental Rights</li>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Parental rights of men refer to the legal and social rights that fathers or male parents have in relation to their children. These rights encompass various aspects of parenting and family life and are essential in ensuring the well-being of both fathers and their children.It is essential to recognize that the specific parental rights for men may vary depending on the country or state's laws and cultural norms. In some regions, progress has been made to ensure greater gender equity in parental rights, while in others, there may still be work to do in this regard. The ultimate goal should be to promote a system that prioritizes the best interests of the child and recognizes the value of involved, caring fathers in their children's lives.
                   . Here are some key aspects of parental rights for men:
                    <ol>
                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Custody and Visitation:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Men have the right to seek custody of their children in cases of separation or divorce. Courts typically make custody decisions based on the best interests of the child, and in many jurisdictions, there is a growing trend towards shared custody arrangements that allow both parents to have meaningful involvement in their children's lives.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Parental Responsibility:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Men have the right and responsibility to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, including education, healthcare, and religious practices, when they have legal custody.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Child Support:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> In cases where one parent has primary custody, the other parent (which can be the father or mother) is often required to provide financial support to ensure the child's well-being. Child support obligations are usually determined by the court based on various factors, including the parents' income and the child's needs.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Paternity Leave:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> In some countries and organizations, men may have the right to take paternity leave, allowing them to bond with and care for their newborn or newly adopted child.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Legal Representation:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Men, like any parents, have the right to legal representation in family court proceedings related to child custody, visitation, and support to ensure their rights are protected.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Access to Children's Records: 
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Men have the right to access their children's educational, medical, and other records, provided they have legal custody or visitation rights.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Equal Treatment:

                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> In many jurisdictions, laws have been developed to ensure that parental rights are not based on gender, promoting equal treatment for both mothers and fathers in family court proceedings.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold;line-height: 35px;">Efforts should be made to address any gender disparities in educational attainment, ensuring that both boys and girls have equal access to educational resources and opportunities.
                    Education for men is an essential aspect of society, just as education for women is. Providing quality education to both genders is crucial for promoting social progress, economic growth, and gender equity.Education for men is not about favoring one gender over another but about recognizing the importance of providing equal opportunities and support for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. By promoting equitable education, societies can benefit from the full potential and contributions of both men and women.Here are some key points regarding education for men:
                   <ol>
                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Equal Access:
                    </li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Men should have equal access to educational opportunities, resources, and facilities. There should be no discrimination based on gender in the enrollment and participation of students in educational institutions.</p>


                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Academic Support:

                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Encouraging academic support for male students is essential to ensure that they have the tools and assistance needed to excel in their studies. This support can include tutoring, mentorship programs, and guidance counseling.</p>

                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Breaking down gender stereotypes in education is crucial. This means challenging the notion that certain subjects or fields are more suitable for one gender over the other. Both boys and girls should feel free to pursue their interests and talents without societal pressures.</p>

                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Addressing Underachievement:
                    </li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">In some regions, there is a concern about boys' underachievement in education compared to girls. It is essential to identify the factors contributing to this trend and implement targeted interventions to support boys in their academic pursuits.</p>

                    <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                        Emotional and Social Development:

                 <li style="font-size:25px;color: #800080;margin-top: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Mental Health</li>
                 <p style="font-weight: bold;line-height: 35px;">Mental health for men is a crucial aspect of overall well-being and should be a priority for individuals, families, communities, and societies at large. Men, like women, can experience a range of mental health issues, but societal expectations and stereotypes about masculinity can sometimes make it challenging for men to seek help or discuss their emotions openly.Here are some important points to consider regarding mental health for men:
                    <ol>
                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Breaking the Stigma:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">One of the most significant barriers to men seeking help for mental health issues is the stigma surrounding mental health. Men may feel pressured to conform to traditional notions of masculinity, which often discourage showing vulnerability or expressing emotions. Raising awareness and breaking the stigma around mental health is essential in encouraging men to seek support and treatment when needed.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Encouraging Open Communication:
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;">Creating safe and supportive spaces for men to talk about their feelings and experiences can be transformative. Encouraging open communication among friends, family, and peers can help men feel more comfortable discussing their mental health challenges.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Access to Mental Health Services: 
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Ensuring that mental health services are accessible, affordable, and tailored to the specific needs of men can be critical in providing effective support. Healthcare providers and professionals should be sensitive to men's unique experiences and challenges when providing care.</p>

                        <li style="font-size:20px;color: #800080;font-weight: bold;">
                            Recognizing Warning Signs: 
                        </li>
                        <p style="font-weight: bold; line-height: 35px;"> Friends, family members, and colleagues should be aware of the warning signs of mental health issues in men, including changes in behavior, social withdrawal, anger, substance abuse, or an increase in risk-taking behaviors. Early intervention and support can make a significant difference in recovery.</p>

        <ul>
            <li style="color: #800080;font-weight: bold;font-size:25px;margin-top: 40px;">Raise Awareness</li>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 20px; line-height: 35px;">Educate the community about the importance of gender equity for men. Challenge stereotypes that perpetuate rigid expectations of masculinity and emphasize the benefits of promoting a more inclusive and diverse society.</p>
            <li style="color: #800080;font-weight: bold;font-size:25px;margin-top: 40px;">Encourage Emotional Expression</li>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 20px; line-height: 35px;">Create safe spaces where men feel comfortable expressing their emotions and seeking support. Encourage open dialogue about mental health, feelings, and struggles, destigmatizing seeking help when needed.</p>
                <li style="color: #800080;font-weight: bold;font-size:25px;margin-top: 40px;">Advocate for Parental Leave</li>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;margin-top: 20px; line-height: 35px;">Support policies and initiatives that provide adequate paternity and parental leave for men. Encouraging men to take an active role in parenting helps break down traditional gender roles and promotes a more balanced family life.</p>
